Assignment 3 Project Plan

We will include a main.cpp driver, ItemType.h, and UnsortedLinkedList.h

Our expectation is that our driver will take a command from the user. This command wil be parsed against a list of commands in
an input text file, and the program will take this command and execute a set of instructions. The output will
be written into an output file that is given by the user.

We will test all of the commands in the given input file. In testing our commands we will also test our header files.
A correctly written output file will mean that our program's drivers, header files, and text files are running
as intended.

The logic will be the following:

Test Cases: 
We will test every command in the input file. We will also test for cases that do not exist in the input files. We
expect that the program will throw our error messages when we test for cases that do not exist in the input file.

class names:
Node
UnsortedLinkedList
ItemType

functions:
// UNSORTED LINKED LIST FUNCTIONS:
 // Constructor
    UnsortedLinkedList();

    // Destructor
    ~UnsortedLinkedList();

    // Get the current length of the list
    int GetLength() const;

    // Add an item to the list
    void PutItem(ItemType item);

    // Print the contents of the list to the console
    void PrintList() const;

    // Get an item from the list and set 'found' to true if found, false otherwise
    ItemType GetItem(ItemType& item, bool& found);

    // Check if the list is full (for a linked list, it's never full)
    bool IsFull() const { return false;}

    // Delete an item from the list
    void DeleteItem(ItemType item);

    // Make the list empty
    void MakeEmpty();

    ItemType GetNextItem();

    void ResetList() { currentPos = nullptr;}

 // ITEM TYPE FUNCTIONS:
    ItemType();
    RelationType ComparedTo(ItemType) const;
    void Print(std::ostream&) const;
    void Initialize(int number);
